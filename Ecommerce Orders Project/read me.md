In this project 3 excel files are used to answer the following questions
    joining 3 datasets
    seeing the range of  payment amount by different payment types
    seeing the payment value by different payment type for eery month year
    total payment value by month

Overall, although the idea is simple, this mini project involves some data manipulation with matplotlib and pandas libraries.
