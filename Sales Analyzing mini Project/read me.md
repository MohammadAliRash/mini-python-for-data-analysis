In this project an excel file is used to answer the following questions and finally, 2 result excel files will be created.
    number of sales with amount > 1000
    number of sales with 3 tops sold
    total sales based on category
    average amount of each category

Overall, although the idea is simple, this mini project involves some data manipulation with matplotlib and pandas library.
